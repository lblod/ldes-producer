# LDES Producer library

NPM library that allows maintaining a [Linked Data Event Streams](https://semiceu.github.io/LinkedDataEventStreams/).

It is a fork of [The fragmenter service](https://github.com/redpencilio/fragmentation-producer-service).

It offers two public APIs: `getNode` which lets you retrieve a page from the LDES feed,
and `addData` which allows you to enrich the LDES feed with data.

As an LDES feed needs many properties to be properly configured, it is possible to use
environment variables (as described below), so that you only need to call `getConfigFromEnv()` in your code.

An example of usage for retrieving and enriching the LDES feed is proposed below.

### Usage

`npm install @lblod/ldes-producer`

#### Get Node

GetNode requires a `config`, which tells the library how to communicate with the LDES setup,
and other properties scoped to the request, such as a `folder` (i.e the LDES scope, for example `mow-registry`) and a `nodeId` (the page you want to retrieve).

You must also provide a `contentType` (`text/turtle` for RDF turtle), and an optional `resource` option.

Below is an example of a rest endpoint (`express`):

`GET http://localhost/{folder}/{nodeId} -H "Content-Type: text/turtle"`

```ts
import {
  getNode as getNodeFn,
  addData as addDataFn,
  getConfigFromEnv,
  ACCEPTED_CONTENT_TYPES,
} from '@lblod/ldes-producer';

const config = getConfigFromEnv();

try {
  const contentType = req.accepts(ACCEPTED_CONTENT_TYPES) || '';

  const result = await getNodeFn(config, {
    folder: req.params.folder,
    contentType: contentType,
    nodeId: parseInt(req.params.nodeId ?? '1'),
    resource: req.params[0] || '',
  });

  if (result.fromCache) {
    res.header('Cache-Control', 'public, immutable');
  }

  res.header('Content-Type', contentType);

  result.stream.pipe(res);
} catch (e) {
  return next(e);
}
```

#### Add data

AddData requires a `config`, which tells the library how to communicate with the LDES setup,
and other properties scoped to the request, such as a `folder` (i.e the LDES scope, for example `mow-registry`), a `contentType` for the content type payload, the body (the rdf data), and a type of fragmenter (`time-fragmenter` by default, but `prefix-tree-fragmenter` could also be used).

Below, an example of a rest endpoint (`express`):

```
POST http://localhost/{folder} -H "Content-Type: text/turtle"--data-binary '@-' <<EOF
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

ex:subject ex:predicate "object" .
EOF
```

```ts
try {
  const contentType = req.headers['content-type'] as string;
  await addDataFn(config, {
    contentType,
    folder: req.params.folder,
    body: req.body,
    fragmenter: req.query.fragmenter as string,
  });

  res.status(201).send();
} catch (e) {
  return next(e);
}
```

### Configuration

The following environment variables can be set:

- `BASE_URL` (required): the base-url on which this service is hosted. This ensures the service can resolve relative urls.
- `DATA_FOLDER`: the parent folder to store the LDES streams in. (default: `/data`)
- `LDES_STREAM_PREFIX`: the stream prefix to use to identify the streams. This prefix is used in conjunction with the folder name of the stream. (default: `http://mu.semte.ch/streams/`)
- `TIME_TREE_RELATION_PATH`: the path on which the relations should be defined when fragmenting resources using the time-fragmenter. This is also the predicate which is used when adding a timestamp to a new version of a resource. (default: `http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#generatedAtTime`)
- `PREFIX_TREE_RELATION_PATH`: the path on which the relations should be defined when fragmenting resources using the prefix-tree-fragmenter. (default: `https://example.org/name`)
- `CACHE_SIZE`: the maximum number of pages the cache should keep in memory. (default: `10`)
- `FOLDER_DEPTH`: the number of levels the data folder structure should contain. (default: `1`, a flat folder structure)
- `PAGE_RESOURCES_COUNT`: the number of resources (members) one page should contain. (default: `10`)
- `SUBFOLDER_NODE_COUNT`: the maximum number of nodes (pages) a subfolder should contain. (default: `10`)
- `LDES_PRODUCER_LOG_LEVEL`: if set to "debug", will log some debug informations
